## What is Average Order Value?
Average Order Value (AOV) is a metric that tells you the average value of an eCommerce transaction in your online store. In other words, it tells you, on average, how much revenue each order brings in.
It’s calculated as follows:

Average Order Value = Product Revenue / Total Transactions

## Why Calculating Average Order Value is Important
Just like conversion rate, your average order value is also an important key performance indicator (KPI) that’s vital to your online business.

For instance, by improving your conversion rate, you’re encouraging more users to buy from your store. Similarly, by improving the average order value, you’re enticing your customers to spend more whenever they make a purchase.

That means, aside from conversion rate, you’ll also have to focus on average order value in order to increase sales and revenue from your eCommerce store.

### Question 1
Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.
